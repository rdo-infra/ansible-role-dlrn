In the past we shipped it in the bulid-requirements repo inside delorean-deps.repo.\n\nIMO doing it this way, it\u0027s an improvement. For a more organized config file, we may add the mock requirements from epel as a new repo config in the delorean-deps.repo instead of the same as the one for storage, but this is also good.",
