Ansible-role-dlrn
=================


# Overview
This is an Ansible role aimed at setting up a new DLRN instance from scratch.

# Description

[DLRN](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/DLRN) builds and maintains yum repositories following commit streams, usually from OpenStack projects.

The DLRN infrastructure on an instance contains the following components:

- A number of `workers`. A worker is basically a local user, with a local DLRN checkout from the git repo, and some associated configuration.
- An `rdoinfo` user. This user simply hosts a local checkout of the [rdoinfo repository](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo), which is refreshed periodically using a crontab entry.
- A web server to host the generated repos.

You can find more information on the DLRN instance architecture [here](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/delorean-instance/blob/master/docs/delorean-instance.md).

This role can configure the basic parameters required by a DLRN instace, plus all the workers.

# Variables

The role will use the following variables, defined in the inventory:

* `dlrn_server_type` (optional) can be `primary` or `backup`.  A primary server checks periodically
  for changes in repos and synchronizes every build to a passive server if rsync is enabled. A passive
  server receives builds from the primary and serves the repos. Some DLRN configuration will be
   different depending on the server type. Defaults to `primary`.
* `web_domain` (optional) defines the web url used to serve the repositories, without the initial
  `http://` part. Defaults to an empty string.
* `disk_for_builders` (optional), if set, specifies a disk to be used by the role for the workers. This
  disk will be initialized using LVM and mounted as /home.
* `sshd_port` (optional) defines an extra SSH port. The SSH daemon will be configured to use it,
  so you may reduce the number of automated attacks. Defaults to 22.
* `enable_https` (optional) allows us to specify if we want to set up HTTPS
  for the web component. If set to `true`, the required Apache vhost entries will be created. Defaults
  to `false`.
* `dlrn_manage_letsencrypt` (optional), when `enable_https` is set to `true`, tells the role to take care
  of requesting and renewing the HTTPS certificates using LetsEncrypt. If set to `false`, you will be
  responsible of deploying the SSL certificates to the following locations:

  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/`web_domain`/cert.pem: SSL certificate
  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/`web_domain`/privkey.pem: SSL certificate private key
  - /etc/letsencrypt/live/`web_domain`/fullchain.pem: full SSL certificate chain

  Defaults to `false`.
* `cert_mail` (optional), when `dlrn_manage_letsencrypt` is set to `true`, specifies the email address
  used for the LetsEncrypt certificate. Defaults to `test@example.com`.
* `api_workers` (optional) is a list of the workers where the DLRN API will be enabled.
  Defaults to an empty list.
* `api_authentication_drivers` (optional) is a list of the authentication drivers to use for incoming http requests.
  Defaults to DBAuthentication.
* `api_ipa_allowed_group` (required with KrbAuthentication driver) is the group allowed to consume the API.
* `api_keytab_princ` (required with KrbAuthentication driver) defines the keytab principal for retrieving a valid kerberos credential in order to connect IPA server.
* `api_keytab` (required with KrbAuthentication driver) defines the keytab path for retrieving a valid kerberos credential in order to connect IPA server.
* `http_api_keytab` (optional) is the keytab path for decrypt the incoming kerberos token in order to authenticate the request's user.
  Defaults to api_keytab.
* `api_protected_read_endpoints` (optional) impose the authentication for those read-only endpoints.
* `force_python_version` (optional), if set, allows us to force a non-default Python version for
  the DLRN virtualenv. Set it to ``python3`` if you want to use python3 on a CentOS 7 system, for
  example. By default, it is undefined, meaning the default Python version will be used.
* `rdoinfo_shell` (optional). With this we select the shell to use for the user rdoinfo.
* `promoter_shell` (optional). With this we select the shell to use for the user promoter.
* `dlrn_workers` (optional). This dictionary contains the definition of all workers to be deployed
  by the role. Each dictionary entry can contain the following entries:

    and can use two algorithms:

    - '0.date.hash' if the old method is used: 0.<date>.<hash>
    - '0.1.date.hash' if the new method is used: 0.1.<date>.<hash>. This
      method provides better compatibility with the Fedora packaging guidelines.
    - 'minor.date.hash' allows you to specify the minor version to be used, which
      can be different from 0. If this release numbering schema is used, the value

    Defaults to false.
  - `custom_preprocess` (optional): If set, defines a comma-separated list of custom programs or
    scripts to be called as part of the pre-process step. The custom programs will be executed
    sequentially.
    Not defined by default.
  - `keep_changelog` (optional): If set to true, DLRN will not clean the %changelog section from
    spec files when building the source RPM. When set to the default value of false, DLRN will

    different package managers if we are building for different operating system releases,
    such as CentOS 7 (yum) and CentOS 8 (dnf).
    Not defined by default.
  - `additional_koji_tags` (optional): If build_driver is 'dlrn.drivers.kojidriver.KojiBuildDriver'
    this option defines a list of additional tags to be applied to the build, once it is finished.

  - `enable_api_login_logs` (optional): If true, the API will log every authentication and authorization process for protected endpoints and regular logs to the files defined with environment variable API_AUTH_LOG_FILE and DLRN_LOG_FILE respectively. If one/all of them is missing, then It'll be written in the WSGI logs defined in its configuration file.

# Migration notes

If you are migrating a server deployed using [puppet-dlrn](https://github.com/rdo-infra/puppet-dlrn),
please take into account the following details:

* Cron jobs for workers should not be duplicated, however you will have duplicate comments from Puppet
  and Ansible in each crontab. Just make sure the old Puppet comments are removed.
* The `httpd` service may fail to restart on the first deployment. If that is the case, please check if
  there are duplicate files under /etc/httpd/conf.d with different numbers (e.g. 10-trunk-primary.rdoproject.org.conf
  and 25-trunk-primary.rdoproject.org.conf). If that is the case, please remove the file with an older
  timestamp and restart the httpd service.
* The YAML configuration file from the puppet-dlrn instance can be almost completely reused for the
  Ansible role. However, the `cron_hour` and `cron_minute` parameters, which accepted a list in
  puppet-dlrn, now require a string in the same format as required by crontab. For example,
  'cron_minute: [1,31]' would now be 'cron_minute: "1,31'.
* The SSH key generated for each worker may be changed, if it was not created with the default size
  of 2048 bits for RSA keys (CentOS 7 and 8).

# Limitations

The module has only been tested on CentOS/RHEL 7 and 8.

SELinux is set to `enforcing`, and the required SELinux booleans and file contexts
are set. However, there is one limitation with this setup:

* Remote import operations are not working.
