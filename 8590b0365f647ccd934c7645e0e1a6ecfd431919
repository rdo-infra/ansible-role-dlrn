(For example. Nova logs are all created under /var/log/nova for the different nova services [1], with the name of the service as a file name).\n[1] https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/compute/logs.html\n\nThis may be a personal preference kind of thing though, or I might be missing other implications here. It seems very specific for a directory, right now.",
